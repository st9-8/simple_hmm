Here is a simple implementation of an HMM for to master it.

I implement the algorithms used to solve the three mains problems of HMM.

1. Forward algorithm to solve **Likehood problem**
2. Viterbi algorithm to solve **Decoding problem**
3. Baum-Welch algorithm to solve **Learning problem**

The repository will be update to fine-tuned the implemented methods.
